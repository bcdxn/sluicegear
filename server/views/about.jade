              | We are committed to create quality products because we want people to get outside!
              | Sluice hammocks will always be handmade in the US using the best materials. We build
              | to last and give customers a way to experience their favorite places like never
              | before. With each hammock, our small team hopes to pass on a little piece of North
              | Carolina that everyone can enjoy.

            p(class='about-txt')
              | Our name was inspired by the traditional method of gold mining where flakes of
              | valuable gold are separated from worthless dirt. Sluice hammocks are designed and
              | built with a similar philosophy – we’ll get you gear to sift through distraction and
              | capture goodness.
